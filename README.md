# Visualizing basis functions used in finite element methods

This is a Java applet I designed over a decade ago, while in grad school, in partnership with a member of the Civil Engineering faculty. The background, purpose, and functionality of the applet are described in [this paper we co-authored in 2007](http://dilbert.engr.ucdavis.edu/~suku/maxent/papers/maxentreview2007.pdf). The source code for the applet can be found in the ``java`` directory, while the compiled applet and instructions for running it are in the ``class`` directory.
