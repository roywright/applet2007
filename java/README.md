# Java code

A fair amount of my code here is built upon the work of others; in fact, a few of these files are simply copies of code that can probably still be found elsewhere on the web. I am working on retracing my steps from years ago so that I can give those other authors proper credit. But for now, the comments seen in some of these files may indicate the original sources from which I derived my own code.

My code here can generally be distinguished by its embarrassing lack of explanatory comments. Most "comments" in my code are simply lines of old code that I have commented out. When I worked on this applet a decade ago, I did not expect ever to share its code with anyone.
